he key difference between the two implementations is in how they count words:

Your implementation:

python
Copy code
word_count = 0

def count_words(key):
    global word_count
    if key == ' ':
        word_count += 1
        log_key_press(f'Word count: {word_count}')
My implementation:

python
Copy code
def count_words(key):
    text = str(key)  # Convert the key to a string
    word_count = len(text.split())  # Count words by splitting the text by spaces
    print(f"Word count: {word_count}")
You can choose the implementation that fits your requirements. If you're not seeing the word count logged, make sure that the count_words function is being called appropriately when the space key is pressed. Also, ensure that the log_key_press function is correctly implemented in your log_formatter.py file.


does not work jet, 
will look in to that later


thsi will be v 5
