"Serious"KeyLogger

Originally named with a touch of irony, "Serious KeyLogger" was initially intended to be a straightforward open-source keylogger, adopting the title as a nod to its simplicity, similar to that of a screen recorder.

However, as the project progressed, a different perspective emerged. The notion of seriousness shifted from being a hidden, covert recorder to encompassing a comprehensive software solution tailored for enhanced computer management. It's designed to empower users with greater control over their systems while offering a safeguardâ€”a way to document our digital actions more thoroughly. In times when our software fails to preserve drafts of tweets, heartfelt letters, or bursts of creativity, this tool steps in.

The aim is not to surreptitiously capture secrets but to facilitate an inclusive environment where individuals can navigate their digital landscape more effectively, ensuring better oversight and maintaining a record of our endeavors.


At the outset, the initial steps were taken with a complete lack of coding knowledge and zero skills. However, due to the absence of a readily accessible, well-constructed keylogger, we decided to embark on this journey for inspiration. Who could say whether any portion of code from here could serve as a foundation for early stages in basic key capture?

It's crucial to bear in mind the overarching plan for the software: the graphical user interface (GUI) will follow in due course.

PS: we also can not write proper, this is thanks to language model. 


In the first set of tests located at:  https://github.com/Looduseline/seriouskeylogger/tree/master
 the current focus lies on the need to improve the system's capability. Specifically, the goal is to enable it to capture words, sentences, and conversations in contrast to the current functionality of recording individual letters line by line in the initial version (v0.py). Please note that v0.py serves as a standalone and basic sample. The more comprehensive functionality originates from the main.py file.

The primary objective now is to enhance the system's capacity to record complete words, sentences, and conversational context rather than isolating individual letters within each line. This improvement aims to provide more meaningful and accurate logs.

To achieve this advancement, Serious KeyLogger (SKL) needs to incorporate text analysis. This involves dissecting input text into words, sentences, and contextual units. The collected data will then be organized and stored accordingly. Implementing this may require employing more advanced text processing and parsing techniques.

In dedication to my mother.
