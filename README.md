"Serious"KeyLogger

Originally named with a touch of irony, "Serious KeyLogger" was initially intended to be a straightforward open-source keylogger, adopting the title as a nod to its simplicity, similar to that of a screen recorder.

However, as the project progressed, a different perspective emerged. The notion of seriousness shifted from being a hidden, covert recorder to encompassing a comprehensive software solution tailored for enhanced computer management. It's designed to empower users with greater control over their systems while offering a safeguardâ€”a way to document our digital actions more thoroughly. In times when our software fails to preserve drafts of tweets, heartfelt letters, or bursts of creativity, this tool steps in.

The aim is not to surreptitiously capture secrets but to facilitate an inclusive environment where individuals can navigate their digital landscape more effectively, ensuring better oversight and maintaining a record of our endeavors.
