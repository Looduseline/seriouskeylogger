Use the Code to Read Configuration: In your main program or any module that needs to access these settings, use the code snippet I provided earlier. Replace the comments (# ...) with the specific settings you want to retrieve from the configuration file. For example:

python
Copy code
import json

with open('config/settings.json') as f:
    config = json.load(f)

log_format = config.get('log_format', '[SPACE]')
enable_feature1 = config.get('enable_feature1', False)
feature1_settings = config.get('feature1_settings', {})
enable_feature2 = config.get('enable_feature2', False)
You can then use these variables (log_format, enable_feature1, etc.) throughout your code to determine how certain parts of your program behave.
